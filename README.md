## 🚧 **Project on Ice – For Now!** ❄️  

Hey there, fellow coder/explorer/random visitor! 👋  

So, if you stumbled upon this project thinking, *"Wow, a cool API for Growtopia! Let’s check it out!"*—I have some news for you. This project is currently **on ice** 🧊, meaning it's not actively being worked on **for a while**.  

### **Why is it on hold?** 🤔  
Great question! Life happens, other projects pop up, priorities shift, and sometimes, you just need a break from scraping websites and battling 403 Forbidden errors. 🚧  

Right now, I don’t have the time (or energy) to keep maintaining or improving this API. That means:  
- **No new features** will be added anytime soon  
- **No bug fixes** (so if something breaks, well... it stays broken 😅)  
- **No active support** (you’re on your own for now)  

### **Will it ever come back?** 🔄  
Maybe! I’m not completely abandoning it—just putting it in **deep freeze** for now. If I get the time or motivation in the future, I might **revive it** and add some cool new features. But no promises!  

### **What can you do in the meantime?**  
- **Fork the project** and improve it yourself! 🚀  
- **Report issues**, but don’t expect them to be fixed quickly.  
- **Stay tuned** in case I come back to update things.  

### **Final Words** 📝  
Thanks to everyone who showed interest in this little project! It was fun to build, but for now, it’s time to hit pause. If you want to contribute or take over development, go for it—I’d love to see where you take it.  

Until then... stay awesome, and happy coding! 🎩✨
